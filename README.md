## HousePriceAI

In this project, we aim to operationalize a machine learning microservice API that predicts housing prices in Boston. We have a pre-trained sklearn model that takes various features into account, such as average rooms, highway access, and teacher-to-pupil ratios, to estimate house prices. The project focuses on containerizing the Python Flask application, app.py, which serves predictions through API calls.
